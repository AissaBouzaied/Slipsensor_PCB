# Slipsensor_PCB
Small and simple PCB that gives 5V and 12V power to our slipsensor which measures the speed of the car and yaw rate. These measurments go through some signal processing in the pcb then to the ECU. This PCB was done as prototype solution to test our slipsensor and the signal processing(analog and digital).
